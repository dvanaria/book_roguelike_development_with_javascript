        1900 x 842

    My laptop screen is set to:

        1920 x 1080

    So yes, the browser window pixel resolution is accurate.


    In code (JS), the way to get the accurate pixel resolution from the browser
    is to use:

        window.innerWidth     (1056? no should be 1900)
        windoe.innerHeight    (476? no should be 842)

        HOWEVER, this isn't the whole story!

        You need to MULTIPLY these values by your device's DPR (Device Pixel Ratio).
        What is DPR? 

            x window.devicePixelRatio
